### Instructions

1. Download [cnc-ddraw.zip](https://github.com/FunkyFr3sh/cnc-ddraw/releases/latest/download/cnc-ddraw.zip) and extract it into your game folder
2. Start the game

Wine (Linux/macOS) only: override `ddraw` in [winecfg](https://wiki.winehq.org/Winecfg#Libraries) manually or run cnc-ddraw config.exe once.

&nbsp;

If you use cnc-ddraw with a game that got its own windowed mode built in then **make sure you disable the games own windowed mode** first. You can enable windowed mode via cnc-ddraw config.exe instead.

&nbsp;

**If the game starts but it doesn't work perfectly** then open the config program and check the **Compatibility settings**.

&nbsp;

**cnc-ddraw does not support Direct3D/Glide**, it will only work with games that use a **DirectDraw (Software)** renderer. Usually you can tell by the look of the game if it's a 3D game or not, but you can also let cnc-ddraw generate a debug log and search for "IDirect3D" - Link: https://github.com/FunkyFr3sh/cnc-ddraw/issues/44

&nbsp;

Some games may require additional steps before they can be used with cnc-ddraw, please check the [wiki](https://github.com/FunkyFr3sh/cnc-ddraw/wiki) for more details.

&nbsp;

**If the game doesn't start at all or it's crashing**, [then please generate a debug log file and upload it.](https://github.com/FunkyFr3sh/cnc-ddraw/issues/44)
